            <h1>Project Overview</h1>
            <p>Our project focused on creating a teachable machine capable of image recognition, with the broader aim of exploring the ethical and societal implications of algorithm development. Through this process, Joy Buolamwini's <em>“Unmasking AI”</em> served as a guiding framework, emphasizing the necessity of equitable, transparent, and inclusive artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p>The teachable machine was trained on seashells, rocks, and turtles to recognize and classify images using a supervised learning model, as well as a neutral class category...</p>

        <section class="reflections">
            <h2>Reflections</h2>
            <p>Working on this project provided first-hand insight into the complexities of developing ethical AI. While we were inspired by Buolamwini’s call for inclusivity, we also grappled with the limitations of our resources. Creating a perfectly unbiased model is nearly impossible, and trade-offs had to be made between fairness, accuracy, and feasibility.</p>
            <p>Buolamwini’s idea that "AI systems are mirrors of power" resonated deeply as we realized that even small decisions, such as how to label data or which metrics to prioritize, could reinforce or challenge existing power dynamics...</p>

                <h3>The Process</h3>
                <p>
                    Once we selected our 3 objects to train our model with, and had gathered variations of each of the objects, we began the training process.
                    We used a mixture of recorded images using a webcam, making sure to get a variety of angles for each object, as well as a small handful of collected images to ensure our model had a mix of examples to learn from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We found our model needed additional training for a Neutral category, and we chose to train it not only on a neutral background, but also incorporating faces and AI generated human faces; to teach our machine that a face could be "ignored" and to instead focus on the objects it was showed to identify.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After several iterations our model studied our images, processed them, and was ready to be tested.

                <h3>Export and Deployment</h3>
                <p>
                    With the model trained and tested, we could now export it to the cloud hosting by Google, embed in our website, and start to play.
