            <p><strong>Xiaoyu Guo:</strong> Exploring the concept of intersectionality was truly eye-opening for me. It’s a reminder that our identities are complex, and how we’re perceived in society isn’t just based on one factor but a mix of many. I found it especially helpful in understanding my own experiences in tech and how we can work towards a more inclusive environment.</p>

            <img src="xiaoxue.jpg" alt="Xiaoxue" class="reflection-image">
            <p><strong>Xiaoxue Lin:</strong> The discussion on implicit bias struck a chord with me. As someone who's passionate about UX design, understanding how unconscious biases can affect decision-making and user experience design is critical. I hope to apply these insights to create more inclusive and bias-aware products.</p>

            <p><strong>Yixin Ye:</strong> Implicit Bias Training (IBT) is a powerful tool for raising awareness of how deeply rooted our biases are. I appreciated the opportunity to reflect on how these biases manifest in the tech world, especially in the way algorithms are trained. This learning experience encouraged me to think more critically about fairness in AI.</p>
