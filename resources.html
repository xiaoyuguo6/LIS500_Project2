            <h3>What is Intersectionality?</h3>
            <p>Intersectionality is a theoretical framework that examines how different aspects of a person's social and political identities (such as race, gender, sexuality, class, and ability) overlap and intersect, creating unique and compounded experiences of discrimination, privilege, or oppression. It was first introduced by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw in the late 1980s to describe how Black women, in particular, experience oppression in ways that cannot be understood in terms of either race or gender alone. The concept emphasizes that discrimination cannot be examined solely in terms of a single axis (such as only race or only gender) but must account for the multiple dimensions that shape people's lived experiences. Intersectionality is used widely in disciplines like sociology, psychology, and law to better understand systemic inequalities and advocate for more comprehensive approaches to justice.</p>

            <h3>What is Implicit Bias?</h3>
            <p>Implicit bias refers to the attitudes, stereotypes, and beliefs that we unconsciously hold towards certain groups of people. These biases are automatic, often without conscious awareness, and they can influence our actions, decisions, and judgments in subtle ways. Unlike overt prejudice, implicit biases may conflict with our declared beliefs and values. For example, even individuals who believe in fairness and equality may still harbor unconscious biases that influence how they view and treat people based on race, gender, or other characteristics. Implicit biases develop over time from societal and cultural conditioning, and they can affect everything from hiring decisions to interpersonal interactions. Identifying and addressing implicit bias is a critical step in creating more inclusive and equitable environments.</p>

            <h3>What is IBT?</h3>
            <p>Implicit Bias Training (IBT) refers to programs and educational tools designed to help individuals recognize and reduce the unconscious biases they may hold. The goal of IBT is to raise awareness of how these biases influence decision-making processes in various settings, such as the workplace, healthcare, and education. Through the training, participants learn about the science behind implicit bias, examine their own biases, and develop strategies to mitigate their impact on interactions with others. IBT can include a range of activities, from taking bias-related tests like Harvard’s Implicit Association Test (IAT) to engaging in discussions, workshops, or simulations. By fostering self-awareness, these trainings aim to create more equitable, fair, and inclusive environments.</p>

        <h2>Our Reflections on the Learning</h2>
        
        <div class="reflection-item">
            <p><strong>Xiaoyu Guo:</strong> 
                Learning about intersectionality opened my eyes to how multi-dimensional our identities are and how these dimensions interact to create unique experiences. I was struck by how society often simplifies these identities, focusing on just one aspect, like race or gender, when in reality, we’re all shaped by a combination of factors. This is especially true in tech, where people's experiences with AI and automation vary dramatically depending on their background. As a web developer, it’s crucial for me to understand this concept so I can design systems that are accessible and equitable for everyone. This also makes me reflect on my own position in the tech space, and how my identity may afford me privileges or obstacles that others don’t face. Going forward, I’ll aim to create digital experiences that take intersectionality into account, ensuring that no single group is prioritized over others. I also see the need for more education on this topic across the tech industry. Many of us tend to focus only on improving diversity metrics without addressing the complex, underlying systems of privilege that exist. This learning experience has shown me that being truly inclusive requires acknowledging and addressing these deep-rooted biases. I'll take these lessons into my future work, ensuring that inclusivity is a top priority in every project I take on.

            <p><strong>Xiaoxue Lin:</strong> 
                The discussion on implicit bias has really shifted my understanding of how unconscious biases can creep into our decision-making, especially in tech design. As someone who is interested in UX design, I often think about the user journey, but now I realize that my own biases could unconsciously influence design decisions, potentially making a product less inclusive. Implicit biases, whether related to gender, race, or ability, can manifest in the simplest choices—like which user scenarios we design for first or how we structure our language in user prompts. This reflection made me re-examine some of my own design projects. For example, I've been working on a health app, and I now wonder if it inadvertently favors certain demographics over others. I learned that it's not just about being aware of bias but actively working to counter it. That’s why IBT (Implicit Bias Training) has become so crucial. It gives us the tools to recognize and mitigate these biases. But beyond training, the next step for me is to continuously self-reflect and invite diverse perspectives into my design process to ensure that what I create is as inclusive as possible. I feel empowered by this learning experience, as it reminded me that small, conscious changes can have significant impacts on the inclusivity of a product. My goal now is to ensure that every project I work on actively addresses and mitigates implicit bias from start to finish.

                Implicit Bias Training (IBT) and intersectionality both helped me understand the broader implications of AI and machine learning in society. The biases that we unconsciously hold are often replicated in the algorithms and AI systems we create, and this perpetuates inequality in ways that are often invisible. In the past, I would hear terms like 'bias in AI' and think it was just about improving the algorithm’s accuracy. But this course showed me that the issue is far more systemic. It’s about who gets to define what is “normal” in the first place. In AI training data, certain groups—whether by race, gender, or class—are often underrepresented, and this leads to skewed results when those algorithms are applied. This made me think critically about how we as developers and scientists have a responsibility to mitigate these biases at the root, ensuring that AI and machine learning serve everyone fairly. The more I learn about AI ethics, the more I realize how much we still need to work on in terms of fairness and equity. I’m committed to making sure I do my part in building a fairer tech landscape moving forward.
