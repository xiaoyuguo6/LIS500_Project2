            <h3>What is Intersectionality?</h3> <!-- Heading for the first resource -->
            <p>
                Intersectionality is a theoretical framework that examines how different aspects of a person's social 
                and political identities (such as race, gender, sexuality, class, and ability) overlap and intersect, 
                creating unique and compounded experiences of discrimination, privilege, or oppression. The concept of 
                intersectionality was first coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw in the 1980s to highlight the unique challenges 
                faced by Black women. Intersectionality helps us understand that various forms of oppression (like 
                racism, sexism, ableism, and classism) do not exist independently but are interconnected and influence 
                each other. This framework is widely used in social sciences, law, and advocacy to ensure a more 
                inclusive and equitable approach to justice by taking into account these multiple, interacting forms of 
                identity and inequality.

            <h3>What is Implicit Bias?</h3> <!-- Heading for the second resource -->
            <p>
                Implicit bias refers to the attitudes, stereotypes, and beliefs that we unconsciously hold towards 
                certain groups of people. These biases operate without us being aware of them and can affect our actions, 
                decisions, and perceptions in ways we may not intend. Implicit biases develop over time from societal and 
                cultural conditioning, and they influence everything from how we interact with others to how we assess 
                their competence and abilities. Examples of implicit bias include assumptions based on race, gender, age, 
                or appearance. Understanding and addressing implicit bias is crucial in creating fair and equitable 
                environments, especially in areas like hiring practices, policing, healthcare, and education.

            <h3>What is IBT?</h3> <!-- Heading for the third resource -->
            <p>
                Implicit Bias Training (IBT) refers to programs and educational tools designed to help individuals 
                recognize and reduce the unconscious biases they may hold. The goal of IBT is to raise awareness of how 
                these biases influence decision-making processes in various settings, such as workplaces, healthcare, 
                and education. Through these trainings, participants learn about the science behind implicit bias, 
                engage in activities like self-assessment (such as Harvard's Implicit Association Test), and develop 
                strategies to mitigate the impact of these biases. By fostering awareness and promoting deliberate 
                actions, IBT aims to create more equitable and inclusive environments where decision-making is fairer and 
                not influenced by unconscious stereotypes.

        <h2>Our Reflections on the Learning</h2> <!-- Section heading -->

        <!-- First reflection by Xiaoyu Guo -->
        <div class="reflection-item">
            <p><strong>Xiaoyu Guo:</strong> 
                Learning about intersectionality opened my eyes to how multi-dimensional our identities are and how 
                these dimensions interact to create unique experiences of privilege or oppression. Intersectionality 
                helps us understand that people’s experiences of discrimination are not just based on a single factor, 
                like race or gender, but often result from the intersection of multiple identities. This has important 
                implications for tech development, as the algorithms we create may unintentionally reinforce these 
                disparities. I now realize the importance of considering all dimensions of identity in my work as a 
                developer.
            </p>

        <!-- Second reflection by Xiaoxue Lin -->
        <div class="reflection-item">
            <p><strong>Xiaoxue Lin:</strong> 
                The discussion on implicit bias has really shifted my understanding of how unconscious biases can creep 
                into our decision-making, even when we believe we are being objective. As someone interested in UX 
                design, this learning has made me rethink the way I approach design decisions. Biases—whether related to 
                race, gender, or ability—can easily find their way into user interfaces and experiences, often without us 
                realizing it. By becoming aware of these biases, I can work to create more inclusive, user-friendly 
                designs.
            </p>

        <!-- Third reflection by Yixin Ye -->
        <div class="reflection-item">
            <p><strong>Yixin Ye:</strong> 
                Implicit Bias Training (IBT) and intersectionality both helped me understand the broader implications of 
                AI and machine learning in society. The biases that we unconsciously hold can be reflected in the AI 
                systems we create, perpetuating inequality. It’s not just about improving algorithmic accuracy, but also 
                about ensuring fairness by addressing these biases at their root. These concepts will shape how I approach 
                future projects and ensure that my work contributes to more ethical AI development.
